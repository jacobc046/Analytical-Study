## Analytical Study
# Showcases the relationship between Atmospheric Carbon and Tropical Storm Intensities. analyzed data using Python libraries Matplotlib, Numpy, and Scipy.

This Python project performs a statistical analysis between the rising atmospheric carbon concentration and the increase in tropical storm intensities over the past 20 years. In addition to the calculations of descriptive statistics, this program creates multiple visuals to illustrate frequency and correlation of data through histograms, box plots, and line graphs.
